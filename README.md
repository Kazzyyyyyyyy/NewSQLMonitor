This is my second real and big C# project. 
After I completed my ToDoList, I knew what a headache it could be to work with SQLite DBs without a good way to manage them in real time. 
So I decided a dev tool for exactly that would be my second project. 
(Yeah, I couldve just used the original program from the SQLite devs, but I wanted to make one myself)

---------------------------------------------------

I started the project with the demand on myself to keep the code more structured because I planned from the start to release the project someday. 
Also wanted to use more advanced and user-friendly options, like keeping the settings in JSON instead of a TXT file.

---------------------------------------------------

Learned far more in this project than in the ToDoList one. 
I actually learned how to make WPF GUIs myself, live data management, how to work with JSON files, and working multiple classes.

The code quality didnt improve compared to my first big project, so I didnt really do what I wanted to there. 
I really dont recommend anyone to work on this project further. 
For me, its okay because I made it, but anyone else would need a lot of time to understand everything (I think).

---------------------------------------------------

But Im still really happy with the end product here. 
I sadly didnt actually use it yet because this was my last real project with SQLite I made (to this day: 18.7.25). 
But Im sure it would work pretty well.
